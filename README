Usage  

This page describes how to use pypixel in your code.

Installation

As of writing, the whole pypixel library is one single Python file: pypixel.py. There is also an examples directory with example code written with pypixel that you can run. Users can simply copy pypixel.py to the directory with their code in it and start using it.

Documentation

From inside the Python interactive interpreter:

    import pypixel
    help(pypixel)

or simply type

    pydoc pypixel

from the command line.

This will use the built-in doc-strings in pypixel to let your browse the class documentation.
