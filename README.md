## Installation

As of writing, the whole pypixel library is one single Python file: `pypixel.py`. There is also an examples directory with example code written with pypixel that you can run. Users can simply copy `pypixel.py` to the directory with their code in it and start using it.

## Documentation

From inside the Python interactive interpreter:

    import pypixel
    help(pypixel)

or simply type

    pydoc pypixel

from the command line.

This will use the built-in doc-strings in pypixel to let your browse the class documentation.
